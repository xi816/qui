# qui
My new qui language compiler

## How to use:
### Run
To only compile a program, you need to run `python3 run.py -c path/to/qui/file path/to/c/file --std=std/directory`\
To  compile and run a program, you need to run `python3 run.py -C path/to/qui/file path/to/c/file --std=std/directory`

> [!WARNING]
>Std directory needs for stack/stack operations? and it's path goes from the .qui file that you will run!
